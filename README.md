# Oversight
Verification and Validation tool for Smart Contracts

Oversight is a formal verification tool for Smart Contracts written in Solidity that should be able to produce both proofs and counter examples. 
The tool will aim to be highly automated in nature and once a functioning prototype of the tool exists, it will be tested in a controlled environment by using techniques such as assertion testing using example solidity code. 
Through this process, the tools functionality can be validated with further efforts having been made to implement inference. The further goal to locate bugs/semantic errors within the source code as well as formal verification but without the need for external explicit modifications provided by the user in the test code i.e. (assertion testing).

Unless stated otherwise, branch "master" will contain the release code.
